## Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Install **Visual Studio** (with .NET Core SDK)
- Install **SQL Server** & **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**

### Steps to Setup & Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. **Set up the database**:
   - Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** and create a new database named `EmployeeManagementDB`.
   - Open **Visual Studio** and locate `appsettings.json` in the project.
   - Update the `ConnectionStrings` with your MSSQL database details:
     ```json
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=EmployeeManagementDB;Trusted_Connection=True;"
     }

3. **Run Database Migrations**:
   - Open **Package Manager Console** in Visual Studio and run:
     ```sh
     Update-Database
     ```

4. **Start the API server**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the project folder and run:
     ```sh
     dotnet run
     ```
   - The backend API will start running on `http://localhost:5000/` (or a different port if specified).
   - Or open the project in **Visual Studio** and click "Run".

5. **Login Credentials**:
   - Create your Account and choose your role.  
   - After the first login, users ***Employees*** are required to change their password.
   
6. **JWT Authentication**:
   - After login, a JWT token is stored in **Cookies**.
   - The token is automatically sent with API requests for authentication and role verification.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to **configure your database connection** in `appsettings.json` before running the application.
- After logging in, the **JWT token is stored in Cookies** for authentication.
- Use **Postman** or a similar tool to test API endpoints.
- If the project is not running, check that your database is running and the connection string is correct.
